# GitHub Actions Workspace

This repository is a personal project created to follow and practice concepts from a GitHub Actions course. The main goal is to learn how to automate workflows, manage CI/CD pipelines, and explore the capabilities of GitHub Actions.

## What you'll find here

- Example workflows for building, testing, and deploying code
- Experimentation with different GitHub Actions features
- Notes and documentation from the course

## Why this project exists

I am using this workspace to gain hands-on experience with GitHub Actions, improve my automation skills, and document my learning journey.

Feel free to explore the workflows and use them as references for your own projects!
